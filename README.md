# Banking System Console Application

## Overview
This console application manages client transactions in a banking system. It provides functionalities for creating new clients, logging in with existing credentials, viewing personal information, managing transactions, and password recovery. The system utilizes classes, data structures, and algorithms to efficiently organize and manipulate client data.

## Classes
1. **Transaction**: Represents a single transaction with attributes like transaction ID, name, and date.
2. **Client**: Represents a client in the banking system with attributes such as name, email, phone, address, password, and an array to store transactions.
3. **LinkedListNode**: Represents a node in a singly linked list, used to construct linked lists of clients.
4. **ClientsLinkedList**: Manages a linked list of clients, providing operations for insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Features
- **Client Management**: Creation of new clients, login with existing credentials, and viewing personal information.
- **Transaction Management**: Creation, viewing, and deletion of transactions for individual clients.
- **Password Recovery**: Allows clients to recover their password using their email.
- **Sorting and Hashing**: Implements algorithms like quicksort and hashing for efficient data organization and access.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes a console-based menu system for user interaction.

## Implementation
- Object-oriented programming principles are employed, with classes representing entities and operations.
- Data structures like linked lists and arrays are used to store and manage client information.
- Sorting and hashing algorithms are implemented to optimize data retrieval and manipulation.
- User input is handled through the console, with menu options guiding the user through different functionalities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple yet efficient system for managing client transactions in a banking environment. It demonstrates concepts of data organization, algorithmic efficiency, and user interaction in a real-world scenario.
